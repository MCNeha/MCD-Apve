        <p>Visual messaging, as you can see, again this was the new client I reflected on earlier yesterday where kind of the menu structure is changing a little bit instead of having to click into gate and then choose these individual items, it's a hover state and you'll click on the one you want and then visual messaging. As you can see here is added the current portal client has like admin and the other stuff, but that's all been swapped out for the app Switcher.</p>
        <p>So in visual messaging again.</p>
        <p>We always have filters. We always have sorts kind of important functionality in each of these cause it can get very, very deep in there. So from a base sense and as you can see, like I said, these are date pickers. We learned our lesson with the other one.</p>
        <p>So you can define when your messages are.</p>
        <p>What messages you want to see? So from start or end time to start or end time it it encompasses both at that point. So any message that might have been, even if it's not active. So if we look at these from for example, you see these down here for 8/2 and 85.</p>
        <p>If I define this as August 1st.</p>
        <p>The Stewart midnight to August 2nd.</p>
        <p>Let's do it four, 1300.</p>
        <p>Nope, let's do it for 1400 because that won't catch anything.</p>
        <p>And I still like to hit the buttons myself because I find it easier.</p>
        <p>OK, I can update this.</p>
        <p>I don't have that. Screw that up. I did. I made that nine. No wonder that doesn't work.</p>
        <p>It's just.</p>
        <p>2nd.</p>
        <p>So part of the reason for this is these never end, so they were.</p>
        <p>Functionally, working within that timeline.</p>
        <p>Those messages existed on displays or existed within the system during that timeline.</p>
        <p>If I go back and I clear this.</p>
        <p>Update that.</p>
        <p>8/2 uh, that's why.</p>
        <p>As I'm ninety 8200.</p>
        <p>282.</p>
        <p>What am I missing?</p>
        <p>There are bugs that I didn't know of.</p>
        <p>No.</p>
