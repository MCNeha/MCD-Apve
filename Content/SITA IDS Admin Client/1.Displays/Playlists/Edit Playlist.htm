                <p><span style="background-color: #ff0000;">31:31 VM&#160;Style Clock. As you can see, is turned on. We can turn it off and actually pagination. You can actually tell it not to paginate if you only want one page of messages.</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span style="color: #00008b;">So you got the hard depends on the screen size will determine this in a lot of cases and this template you could create multiple template multiple playlists that have visual messaging for 32 inch screen visual messaging for 55 inch screen. That way you can adjust your font size as you need to and as you can see the dots the bottom have built out and it's starting to rotate between them and it will continue doing that through the end of time if it gets a new message it will add that to the list and then determine what additional space needs to exist.</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="color: #00008b;">Of course, you have all the same color and justification options that you have with the other templates. Justification obviously left or right or center. This is currently in center, which is horrible. Should probably be in left or right in most cases, especially on a larger display. And of course that has a big impact on landscape versus portrait as well for how the font looks in a landscape when you have a lot of messages on the screen or in medium.</p>
