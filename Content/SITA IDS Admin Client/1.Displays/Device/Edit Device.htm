            <li>
                <p>Click on the  <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Edit icon.png" />icon on the right corner of the device. <br />The <b>Edit Device</b> window will display.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Edit the fields you want to change.</p>

            <li>
                <p style="color: #00008b;">And now it's going to rotate through all of those based on the configuration that is in that playlist. </p>
                <p style="color: #00008b;">
                    <img src="Devices - Playlist.png" />
                </p>
                <p style="color: #00008b;">The playlist has a definition for how often the templates rotate between each other. You'll notice it's set to 30 seconds here, so these will flip. These will go from here to here to here all the way through, and back around every 30 seconds. It will flip to a new template.</p>
